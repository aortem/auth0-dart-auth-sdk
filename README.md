### **Core Authentication Methods**

| Authentication Method                         | SDK API                                    | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authorization Code (PKCE)**                 | `loginWithPkce(...)`                       | Standard interactive login using the Authorization Code flow with PKCE for enhanced security. |
| **Silent Authentication**                     | `acquireTokenSilent(...)`                  | Automatically renews access tokens in the background using a stored refresh token.          |
| **Refresh Token Flow**                        | (built into silent auth)                   | Explicitly exchanges a refresh token for a new access token when called directly.           |
| **Client Credentials**                        | `clientCredentialsToken(...)`              | Machine-to-machine (M2M) flow: exchange client ID/secret for an access token.               |
| **Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC)**| `loginWithUsernamePassword(...)`           | Direct username/password login (use sparingly; less secure and not recommended for public apps). |
| **Device Code Flow**                          | `loginWithDeviceCode(...)`                 | User-friendly device flow: poll for authentication on devices without browsers.             |
| **Passwordless (Email OTP)**                  | `loginPasswordlessWithCode(...)`           | One-time code sent via email for passwordless login.                                        |
| **Passwordless (Magic Link)**                 | `loginPasswordlessWithLink(...)`           | Email a magic-link that logs the user in when clicked.                                      |
| **Passwordless (SMS OTP)**                    | `loginPasswordlessWithSms(...)`            | One-time code sent via SMS for passwordless login.                                          |
| **Universal Login (Hosted UI)**               | `loginWithHostedUI(...)`                   | Redirects to Auth0â€™s hosted login page (customizable branding).                             |
| **Social & Enterprise Login**                 | (via Hosted UI)                            | Built-in support for Google, Facebook, Azure AD, SAML, and other connections.               |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**         | (configured in Hosted UI)                  | Enforce second-factor (OTP apps, SMS, email) as part of the hosted login flow.              |
| **Custom OAuth2 Connections**                 | `loginWithOAuth2Connection(...)`           | Plug in generic OAuth2/SAML identity providers not covered out of the box.                  |
