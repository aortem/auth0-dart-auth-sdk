### **Core Authentication Methods**

| Authentication Method                         | SDK API                                    | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authorization Code (PKCE)**                 | `loginWithPkce(...)`                       | Standard interactive login using the Authorization Code flow with PKCE for enhanced security. |
| **Silent Authentication**                     | `acquireTokenSilent(...)`                  | Automatically renews access tokens in the background using a stored refresh token.          |
| **Refresh Token Flow**                        | (built into silent auth)                   | Explicitly exchanges a refresh token for a new access token when called directly.           |
| **Client Credentials**                        | `clientCredentialsToken(...)`              | Machine-to-machine (M2M) flow: exchange client ID/secret for an access token.               |
| **Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC)**| `loginWithUsernamePassword(...)`           | Direct username/password login (use sparingly; less secure and not recommended for public apps). |
| **Device Code Flow**                          | `loginWithDeviceCode(...)`                 | User-friendly device flow: poll for authentication on devices without browsers.             |
| **Passwordless (Email OTP)**                  | `loginPasswordlessWithCode(...)`           | One-time code sent via email for passwordless login.                                        |
| **Passwordless (Magic Link)**                 | `loginPasswordlessWithLink(...)`           | Email a magic-link that logs the user in when clicked.                                      |
| **Passwordless (SMS OTP)**                    | `loginPasswordlessWithSms(...)`            | One-time code sent via SMS for passwordless login.                                          |
| **Universal Login (Hosted UI)**               | `loginWithHostedUI(...)`                   | Redirects to Auth0â€™s hosted login page (customizable branding).                             |
| **Social & Enterprise Login**                 | (via Hosted UI)                            | Built-in support for Google, Facebook, Azure AD, SAML, and other connections.               |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**         | (configured in Hosted UI)                  | Enforce second-factor (OTP apps, SMS, email) as part of the hosted login flow.              |
| **Custom OAuth2 Connections**                 | `loginWithOAuth2Connection(...)`           | Plug in generic OAuth2/SAML identity providers not covered out of the box.                  |

## Available Versions / Sample Apps

Auth0-Dart-Auth-SDK is available in a single version with sample apps:

1. **Main - Stable Version**: Usually one release a month.  This version attempts to keep stability without introducing breaking changes.

2. **Sample Apps - FrontEnd Version**: The sample apps are provided in various frontend languages in order to allow maximum flexibility with your frontend implementation with the Dart backend.  Note that new features are first tested in the sample apps before being released in the mainline branch. Use only as a guide for your frontend/backend implementation of Dart.
